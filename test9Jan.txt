I tried to create a new branch and commit it and push it into the remote repo.
Everything went fine in the local repo as well as in the remote repo
but I don't know why is it that it is not counting all these recent commits in GitHub.

For this, this file has been created...

I found something interseting in this manner i.e if we're working on the cloned repo, then github does not keep track og daily 
contributions, rather, if we're woking on the forked one, then it surely does...
